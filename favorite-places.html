  <h1>My Favorite Places</h1>
  <h2 id="city"><a href="https://www.google.com/maps/place/San+Diego,+CA">San Diego, CA</a></h2>
  <p>San Diego is one of my favorite places I have lived. I first moved to San Diego to attend the University of San Diego in 2013. San Diego has warm weather, beautiful beaches, and <em>great</em> Mexican food.</p>

  <h2 id="city"><a href="https://www.google.com/maps/place/Portland,+OR">Portland, OR</a></h2>
  <p>Despite the rain, Portland is my favorite city. Growing up here, Portland will always be a special place for me. </p>

  <h2 id="city"><a href="https://www.google.com/maps/place/Chicago,+IL">Chicago, IL</a></h2>
  <p>Chicago is one of my favorite places to visit. My younger brother attended Northwestern University in Evanston, IL and when we would visit him we would often explore the city of Chicaog. The city has beautiful architecture, interesting museums, and great nightlife.</p>
